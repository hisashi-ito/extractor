This website is dedicated to research in statistical machine translation, i.e. the translation of text from one human language to another by a computer that learned how to translate from vast amounts of translated text.

Moses is a statistical machine translation system that allows you to automatically train translation models for any language pair.
All you need is a collection of translated texts (parallel corpus).
Once you have a trained model, an efficient search algorithm quickly finds the highest probability translation among the exponential number of choices.

GIZA++ is an extension of the program GIZA (part of the SMT toolkit EGYPT) which was developed by the Statistical Machine Translation team during the summer workshop in 1999 at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns-Hopkins University (CLSP/JHU).
GIZA++ includes a lot of additional features.
The extensions of GIZA++ were designed and written by Franz Josef Och.
